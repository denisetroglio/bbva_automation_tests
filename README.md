## 🛠️ Tecnologies:

- [Pytest BDD](https://pytest-bdd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) Pytest-bdd implements a subset of the Gherkin language to enable automating project requirements testing and to facilitate behavioral driven development.
- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) The main programming language used to develop test scripts.
- [Selenium](https://www.selenium.dev/) A browser automation tool used to simulate user interactions with the web interface.
- [Gherkin](https://cucumber.io/docs/gherkin/) Gherkin is a set of grammar rules that makes plain text structured enough for Cucumber to understand.
- [WebDriverManager](https://pypi.org/project/webdriver-manager/) Automatically manages browser drivers, eliminating the need for manual setup and configuration.
